### Summary

Software/Data Engineering + Predictive Modeling/Machine Learning + LLMs/AI + Data Analysis + Business

My education and experience are uncommonly broad, but I'm substantially deeper and more technical than the other "generalist"s.

I am a technical problem solver and leader. I have education and experience across an unusually broad array of interrelated domains, which allows me to move up-and-down the problem layers, from marketing strategy to bit-flipping algorithm optimizations.
 
- technical
- comfortable with ambiguity
- 
- I have more perspective than your specialists, . I'm a technical leader, unafraid of ambiguity

### Experience

**Machine Learning Engineer & Data Strategist | Simpliphy (Physician 
Compensation Software) | 2024 – Present**

*   Secured a promotion and a 100% compensation increase in 10 months, 
awarded over three performance-based raises in recognition of exceptional 
technical innovation and leadership.
*   Pioneered an all-code reporting architecture by forking and 
extensively modifying the open-source platform Evidence.dev, 
decommissioning Tableau to enhance version control and extensibility.
*   Key modifications included architecting a dynamic, multi-tenant data 
loading solution to serve bespoke data to numerous clients from a single 
codebase—a critical feature not natively supported.
*   Engineered “dash,” an internal Go-based CLI tool leveraging an LLM API 
to automatically analyze and optimize SQL queries, significantly reducing 
manual tuning efforts.
*   Spearheaded the development of an admin manual chatbot using the 
OpenAI API and React, modernizing access to critical information for 
hospital administrators.

**Data Science Engineer | Metis Machine | Charlottesville, VA | 2018**

*   Built machine learning pipeline for classification model using Python 
and Spark SQL.
*   Discovered fatal error in pre-existing model: a "leak from the future" 
that artificially inflated model accuracy by 25%.
*   Engineered new features and rebuilt classification model with clean 
training data.

**Data Analyst | Elder Research (Machine Learning Consultancy) | 2016 – 
2017**

*   Wrangled and cleaned 1 TB dataset using PySpark and Spark SQL.
*   Built propensity model to predict odds-will-donate for public 
university's fundraising campaign, in R.
*   Deployed logistic regression model in MS SQL, per the client's 
requirement.
*   Engineered and validated a logistic regression model in R to predict 
patient no-show likelihood, providing clients with actionable insights for 
scheduling optimization.
*   Leveraged Python, R, Spark, and SQL to clean, process, and analyze 
large-scale healthcare datasets for predictive modeling.
